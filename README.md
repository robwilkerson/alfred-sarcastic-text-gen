# Sarcastic Text Generator | Alfred Workflow

A simple [workflow for Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/workflows/) to express sarcasm in writing. The workflow accepts a string and displays a configurable number of variants of that string in the mixed caps format that has become recognizable as sarcasm.

## Installation

Download the latest release and double click to install the workflow.

## Usage

Use the `sc` "keyword" followed by a string to see a list of variations. Select whichever option you prefer and hit `Enter` to copy that value to the clipboard. Then you can paste the value wherever you'd like to express your snark.

## Configuration

By default, 5 options are shown. If you'd like more (up to 10) or less, just click **Configure Workflow...** and use the slider to change the value as you see fit.
